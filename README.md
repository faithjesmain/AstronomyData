# AstronomyData

## Objective
- Analyzed the transit lightcurve of exoplanet Kepler-10b

## Data Source
- Kepler 

## Tools Used
- Lightkurve, Astropy, Matplotlib, NumPy

## Transit Detection
- Graphs of raw and folded light curves

## Parameter Estimation
- Transit depth (how much a star dims due to planet), Radius ratio (how large a planet is relative to its star)
